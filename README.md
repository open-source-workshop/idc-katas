# IDC Katas Code Challenges

The point of this repository is to allow anyone to start contributing on a
public repository.


## How to participate

1. Find an issue that is **not assigned** yet and ask to be assigned to you
2. Once it's assigned, implement the problem asked in the issue
3. Create a new file with a new problem name and add a example as comment
4. Create your **Pull Request**
5. Create an issue for your new problem

## Rules

- Each PR should contain **exactly 2 files**: your implementation, and a new kata. All pull requests that do not follow this rule will be closed **immediately**.

## Files

You only need to edit the problem **file**, the actual implementation will be left to someone else!

**theFunction.js**:

```js
export const theFunction = () => {
  // TO IMPLEMENT IN ANOTHER PR
};
```
